# Pacman Reinforcement Learning Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Pacman Reinforcement Learning Project! This innovative take on the classic Pacman game employs advanced reinforcement learning techniques, including Markov Decision Processes (MDP), Iterative Value computation, and Q-learning. The aim is to create an autonomous Pacman that learns to navigate the maze, dodge ghosts, and eat pellets more efficiently over time.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning:** The backbone of our Pacman's decision-making, adapting to the game's challenges through rewards.
- **Markov Decision Processes (MDP):** A framework to model the environment and make predictions about future states.
- **Iterative Value Computation:** A method to estimate the utility of actions, guiding Pacman towards better decisions.
- **Q-Learning:** A strategy that enables Pacman to learn from each move's outcome, enhancing its gameplay without prior knowledge of the environment's dynamics.
- **Dynamic Challenges:** The game environment evolves, presenting Pacman with new puzzles to solve using its growing intelligence.
