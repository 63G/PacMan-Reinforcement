Pacman Reinforcement Learning Project
Overview

Welcome to the Pacman Reinforcement Learning Project! This innovative take on the classic Pacman game employs advanced reinforcement learning techniques, including Markov Decision Processes (MDP), Iterative Value computation, and Q-learning. The aim is to create an autonomous Pacman that learns to navigate the maze, dodge ghosts, and eat pellets more efficiently over time.
Features

    Reinforcement Learning: The backbone of our Pacman's decision-making, adapting to the game's challenges through rewards.
    Markov Decision Processes (MDP): A framework to model the environment and make predictions about future states.
    Iterative Value Computation: A method to estimate the utility of actions, guiding Pacman towards better decisions.
    Q-Learning: A strategy that enables Pacman to learn from each move's outcome, enhancing its gameplay without prior knowledge of the environment's dynamics.
    Dynamic Challenges: The game environment evolves, presenting Pacman with new puzzles to solve using its growing intelligence.
